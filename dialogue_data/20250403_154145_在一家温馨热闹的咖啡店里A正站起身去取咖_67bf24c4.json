I was just heading back to my table.\nA: No worries at all, it happens! Just a little jostle. Actually, I couldn't help but notice the book you're holding – 'Klara and the Sun', isn't it? I absolutely adored that novel.\n\n轮次 2:\nB: Oh, you've read it? Fantastic! It's such a thought-provoking piece. In fact, it is this very book that our reading group is discussing next week. We delve into quite a diverse range of contemporary fiction.\nA: A reading group? That sounds brilliant! I've actually been looking for one locally. It’s often quite challenging to find fellow readers who appreciate similar genres these days.\n\n轮次 3:\nB: Well, you might have just found one! We're always welcoming new members who are passionate about literature. Perhaps it is fate that brought us bumping into each other? If you're genuinely interested, we could exchange numbers, and I can send you the details about our next meeting?\nA: That would be absolutely wonderful, thank you! Yes, let's definitely exchange details. I'm really excited about the prospect of joining.",

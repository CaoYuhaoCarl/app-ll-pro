I should have looked where I was going. Your coffee is okay, right?\n\n轮次 2:\nB: Yes, it's fine! Just a little splash. By the way, I couldn't help but notice the book you're reading. Is that 'The Midnight Library'? I've been wanting to read that one.\nA: Yes, it is! I'm really enjoying it so far. Have you read any of Matt Haig's other books? Our book club is actually discussing this one next week.\n\n轮次 3:\nB: I haven't, but I'd love to! Your book club sounds interesting. Are you accepting new members? I've been looking for a group to share reading experiences with.\nA: Absolutely! We meet every Thursday evening at this café. Why don't we exchange contact info? I can add you to our group chat where we share all the details.\n轮次 4:\nB: That would be perfect! Here's my number. *hands phone to A to enter contact details* What kind of books do you usually read in your club? I enjoy a mix of fiction and philosophical works.\nA: *enters contact information and returns phone* We're pretty diverse in our tastes. Last month we read \"The Midnight Library\" and now we're discussing \"Sapiens.\" I just added you to our group chat, so you'll see our upcoming selection soon!\n\n轮次 5:\nB: \"Sapiens\" has been on my reading list for ages! What a coincidence. I actually brought a book with me today - *pulls out a novel from bag* - do you know this author?\nA: Oh, I love that writer! Their perspective on human relationships is so insightful. You know, since you're already here, our informal pre-meeting coffee session is happening at that corner table. Would you like to join us? A few members usually gather before the official meeting.\n\n轮次 6:\nB: I'd be delighted to join! *gathers belongings* Lead the way. I'm excited to meet everyone and get a feel for the discussions before Thursday's official meeting.\nA: Great! *gestures toward the table* Everyone's going to be thrilled to have someone with your taste in literature joining us. I have a feeling you're going to fit right in with our little literary community.\n轮次 7:\nB: *walks with A to the table, smiling warmly* Thank you for making me feel so welcome. I've been looking for something like this since I moved here. *reaches into bag* Oh, we should probably exchange contact information so you can send me details about Thursday's meeting. Here's my phone.\nA: *takes B's phone and inputs contact information* Absolutely! I'll text you the address and time for Thursday. We usually bring snacks to share, but don't worry about it for your first time. *hands phone back* I'm really glad we literally ran into each other today. Funny how accidents can lead to something good.\n\n轮次 8:\nB: *laughs* Yes, it's probably the most fortuitous coffee spill I've ever experienced. *puts phone away* Speaking of which, let me buy you another coffee before we join the others. It's the least I can do since yours ended up mostly on the floor.\nA: *smiles appreciatively* That's really kind of you. I'd love that. And while we're waiting for our order, you can tell me more about that Murakami novel you mentioned. I've always wanted to get into his work but never knew which book to start with.",

Round 1:
B: Oh, I'm so sorry! I didn't see you there. Are you okay?
A: No worries at all! It was just a little bump. I'm fine, thanks.

Round 2:
B: That's good to hear. By the way, I noticed the book you're holding—are you into reading? I run a local book club.
A: Oh, really? I love reading! I've been looking for a book club to join.

Round 3:
B: That's perfect! Would you like to exchange contact details? I can send you more information about our next meeting.
A: Sure, that sounds great! Here's my number: [shares number]. Looking forward to it!
B: Got it! I'll text you the details shortly. By the way, what kind of books do you usually enjoy? We have different reading groups based on genres.  

A: Oh, I mostly read contemporary fiction and the occasional mystery novel. But I'm open to trying new genres too!  

B: Wonderful! Our fiction group is actually discussing a new bestseller next week. I'll add you to that group chat. Do you prefer meeting in person or online?  

A: In person sounds lovely! I enjoy the discussions more when we're all together. This café would be perfect, if that works for the group?  

B: Absolutely! We often meet here on weekends. I'll include the address and time in my text. So glad you're joining us!
A: That's perfect! By the way, would you mind if I added you on WeChat? It'd be great to stay in touch about book club updates and maybe chat about books between meetings too.  

B: Of course! Here's my QR code - I'd love to exchange book recommendations anytime. The club also has a group chat where we share interesting reads and event reminders. I'll add you right after this!

I never thought I’d have the chance to meet you in person!\nB: I'm touched by your kind words. It’s always a pleasure to meet a dedicated reader and admirer.\nA: Since I truly admire you and your work, may I kindly ask for your autograph on my book? It would mean the world to me.\nB: I'd be happy to sign your book. Here you go—consider it a token of our serendipitous meeting.",

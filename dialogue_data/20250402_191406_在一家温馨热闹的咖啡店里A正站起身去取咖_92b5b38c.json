  "original_text": "A: Oh, excuse me! I’m so sorry for bumping into you while I was getting my coffee.\nB: No worries at all, these things happen in a busy coffee shop!\nA: Thank you for understanding. By the way, I couldn’t help but notice the book you’re holding. It’s exactly the edition I’ve been trying to find!\nB: Really? That’s amazing! I’ve always adored that version, it has such a unique cover and style.\nA: I’ve been longing to read it for ages. Would you like to share some thoughts about it over a cup of coffee?\nB: I’d love that! It’s always exciting to meet someone who shares the same taste in literature.\nA: You know, I actually attend a friendly book club here every Wednesday. We discuss various books and share our personal insights.\nB: That sounds wonderful! I haven’t been part of a book club in a while, and I think joining you would be a great way to make new friends.\nA: Exactly what I was thinking. We could explore more books together and perhaps even organize our own little book exchange session.\nB: I’m really looking forward to that. It’s not every day you get invited to join such a warm and welcoming community.\nA: I’m glad you feel that way. I believe this is the start of a great friendship, and who knows, maybe many more shared stories!\nB: Absolutely, thank you for the invitation and for turning a small accident into a delightful opportunity to connect.",

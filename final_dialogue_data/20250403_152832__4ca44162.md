Round 4:  
B: Wow, my god, Darling! (smiling, eyes wide, nodding quietly) Great, I'll send you all the upcoming dates and details right away. By the way, we usually start our meetings with a brief discussion of the latest book—do you have any preferences when it comes to reading genres?

Round 5:  
B: Wow, my god, Darling! (smiling, eyes wide, nodding quietly) That’s awesome! We'll make sure to include a variety of readings to appeal to everyone.

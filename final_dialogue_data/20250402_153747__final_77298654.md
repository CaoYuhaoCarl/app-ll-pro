A: Oh, excuse me. I’m really sorry for bumping into you.  
B: No worries at all—I'm totally okay! How are you doing?  
A: I'm fine, thank you. I just noticed you're reading that special edition of the book I've been quietly searching for. I'm Alex, by the way.  
B: It's great to meet you, Alex! I'm Bella. Yep, it’s a really rare edition and one of my favorites—I love talking about it.  
A: That’s wonderful. I have a deep passion for literature, travel, and music, so it seems we might share similar interests.  
B: Absolutely! In fact, I run a monthly reading club where we dive into books, swap travel tales, and chat about music. Would you be interested in joining us?  
A: I would love that, Bella. It sounds like the perfect opportunity to explore our common interests and make new friends.  
B: Fantastic! Let’s exchange contact details. And, get this—I’m actually the writer you’ve admired online. What a fun coincidence! I’m really looking forward to many more conversations.

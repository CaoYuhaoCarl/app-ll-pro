Round 1:
B: [ smiled ] Oh, I'm so sorry! Let me help you pick up those books. Are you okay?
A: No problem at all! Thanks for catching that one. I was just heading to the counter.

Round 2:
B: [ thinking ] Those books look interesting! Do you read a lot? I'm part of a local book club if you're interested.
A: Actually, I love reading! What kind of books does your club discuss?
B: [ smiled ] Mostly contemporary fiction and classic novels. Would you like me to send you our next meeting details via email?
A: [ raised an eyebrow ] That'd be great! My email is alex@example.com. See you there!
B: [ smiled ] Perfect! I just sent you the invite. Our next discussion is on *Pachinko* by Min Jin Lee—have you started reading it yet?
A: [ smiled ] Not yet, but I’ll dive in soon! The plot sounds fascinating. Do you usually meet here at the café?
B: [ nodded ] Yep, we rotate spots but love this place for the cozy vibe. Oh, and we also have a Discord server for book updates—want me to add you?
A: [ smiled ] Absolutely! My Discord tag is BookLover#4242. Thanks for including me! 
B: [ smiled ] Will do! And here’s my number in case you need reminders— [ shows phone ] Text me if you’re ever unsure about the location!
A: Grateful! Same for you if I’m late grabbing coffee next time. Looking forward to the meet!

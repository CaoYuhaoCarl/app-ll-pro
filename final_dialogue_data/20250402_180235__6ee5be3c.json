Your name is the very same writer I've admired online for a long time. I never thought I'd meet you in person!  \nB: Emm, that's so sweet of you! I'm really happy to meet a dedicated admirer.  \nA: Since I truly admire your work, may I kindly ask for your autograph on my book? It would mean the world to me.  \nB: Emm, of course! Here you go—please consider it a little memento of our happy meeting.",

## 最终对话

```
A: Oh, excuse me, I'm really sorry for bumping into you while I was getting my coffee.

B: Wow, sweetheart, it's totally okay! No worries at all.

A: I… I couldn’t help but notice you're reading the exact edition of the book I've been searching for so long.

B: Wow, really, sweetheart? That's such a rare find! This is one of my absolute favorites—I just love how it sparks the most interesting discussions.

A: Me too. I always enjoy talking about books and learning new perspectives. It seems we share that common love.

B: Wow, exactly! I actually belong to a local literature club where we dive into our favorite reads and share tons of ideas.

A: That sounds… really amazing. I'd really like to get to know you better and maybe even join your club.

B: Wow, sweetheart, I’d be delighted to have you join us. Here’s some information about our next meeting. Welcome, new friend!

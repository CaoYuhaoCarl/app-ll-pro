# Rewritten Dialogue

## Round 1:
*Bouncing nervously on her toes* Oops! Oh my goodness, I'm so terribly sorry for bumping into you! Are you okay? I wasn't looking where I was going!

BigW: Yes, I'm fine, thank you. The fault was mine while getting coffee.

## Round 2:
*Smiling brightly with visible relief* I'm really glad you're alright! I couldn't help but notice you were reading earlier. I just finished reading Journey to the West and it reminded me of our book club discussions. Would you mind joining our next meeting? We have fascinating conversations about literary themes.

BigW: That sounds... acceptable. I enjoy literature. I would be willing to join.

## Round 3:
*Clapping her hands excitedly* Fantastic! That's wonderful news! Could you please share your contact information so I can add you to our club group? Of course, I'll send you all the details soon. We're a friendly bunch, I promise!

BigW: Sure. Here is my information. I look forward to the discussion.

## Round 4:
BigW: When and where will the first meeting take place?

*Leaning forward with enthusiasm* Absolutely! Our first meeting is scheduled for this Saturday at 7 p.m. right here in the back area of the café. We'll start with a quick intro session before diving into our discussion. It'll be so much fun!

## Round 5:
BigW: What book will we be discussing?

*Twirling a strand of hair thoughtfully* Sure thing! We're kicking off with "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee. It's a captivating read and should spark some really engaging conversations. Have you read it before? The themes are quite profound!

## Round 6:
BigW: "To Kill a Mockingbird" is a significant work. I have thoughts to share. Thank you for the invitation.

*Nodding enthusiastically* You're most welcome, BigW! We're all excited to hear your insights. See you on Saturday for what promises to be a lively discussion!

BigW: By the way, I received the WeChat invitation to the group. Thank you for arranging this.

*Waving happily* That's great to hear, BigW! Welcome aboard officially. I've added you to our book club group chat so you'll receive all the updates. Oops, I'm getting so excited! I can't wait to see your insights on Saturday—see you soon!

    "original_text": "B: Oh, I'm so sorry! Are you okay? I didn't see you standing there.\nA: I'm fine, thank you. I'm the one who should be sorry, I wasn't watching where I was going.\n\nB: No worries at all. I'm actually a member of the local book club that meets here sometimes. We're meeting next week to discuss a great novel. Would you like to join us?\nA: That sounds wonderful! I've been looking for a book club to join. What's the title of the book you're reading next?\n\nB: We're reading \"The Nightingale\" by Kristin Hannah. It's a historical fiction novel that I think you'll really enjoy. If you're interested, I'd be happy to add you to our WhatsApp group. Here's my number, so you can join us.\nA: That sounds great! I'd love to join the WhatsApp group. *exchanges phone number* Thank you so much for inviting me!\nB: You're welcome! I'm sure you'll enjoy our discussions. We meet every two weeks at a different member's home to discuss the book. We also have a lively debate about the themes and characters in the WhatsApp group.\n\nA: That sounds like so much fun! I love debating with others about the books I've read. What's the vibe like in the group? Is it very formal or more relaxed?\n\nB: It's really relaxed and friendly. We're all book lovers who just want to share our passion for reading with others. You'll fit right in, I think. I'll send you a message with the details of our next meeting, and you can join us if you'd like.\n\nA: That would be great, thank you! I'm looking forward to it. And I'm sure I'll enjoy \"The Nightingale\" - I've heard great things about it.\nA: By the way, how should we stay in touch? You've been so helpful, and I'd love to get your recommendations on other books in the future.\n\nB: Great point! Let's exchange phone numbers or WeChat IDs.

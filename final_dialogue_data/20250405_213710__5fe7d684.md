A: "Yes, I'm fine, thank you. I wasn't careful while getting my coffee."

Round 2:
B: "I'm so relieved you're alright, BigW! I noticed you were reading earlier. I just finished reading Journey to the West, and it got me thinking about our book club. Would you mind joining our next meeting?" [B says this with sparkling eyes and an excited wave of the hand]
A: "That sounds great! I love reading, and I'd be happy to join the book club."

Round 5:
A: "That sounds perfect. May I ask what book we'll be discussing at the meeting?"
B: "Sure thing! We're kicking off with 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee. It’s a captivating read that should spark some really engaging conversations." [B explains with animated gestures and a bright smile]

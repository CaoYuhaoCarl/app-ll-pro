## 最终对话

```
Round 1:
B: Oh, I'm so sorry! Let me help you pick up those books. Are you okay?
A: No problem at all! Thanks for catching that one. I was just heading to the counter.

Round 2:
B: Those books look interesting! Do you read a lot? I'm part of a local book club if you're interested.
A: Actually, I love reading! What kind of books does your club discuss?

Round 3:
B: Mostly contemporary fiction and classic novels. Would you like me to send you our next meeting details via email?
A: That'd be great! My email is alex@example.com. See you there!
Round 4:  
B: Perfect! I just sent you the invite. Our next discussion is on *Pachinko* by Min Jin Lee—have you started reading it yet?  

A: Not yet, but I’ll dive in soon! The plot sounds fascinating. Do you usually meet here at the café?  

Round 5:  
B: Yep, we rotate spots but love this place for the cozy vibe. Oh, and we also have a Discord server for book updates—want me to add you?  

A: Absolutely! My Discord tag is BookLover#4242. Thanks for including me!  

Round 6:  
B: Will do! And here’s my number in case you need reminders—[shows phone] Text me if you’re ever unsure about the location!  

A: Grateful! Same for you if I’m late grabbing coffee next time. Looking forward to the meet!

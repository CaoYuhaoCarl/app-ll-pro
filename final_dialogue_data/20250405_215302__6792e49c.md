A: Yes, I’m fine, thank you. I wasn’t careful while getting my coffee.

Round 2:
B: 【Cheerfully leaning in】Oops, I’m relieved you’re alright, BigW. I noticed you were reading earlier. I just finished reading Journey to the West, and it reminded me of our book club. Would you mind joining our next meeting?  
A: That sounds great! I love reading, and I’d be happy to join the book club.

A: That sounds perfect. May I ask what book we’ll be discussing at the meeting?  
B: 【Energized with a chuckle】Oops, sure thing, BigW! We’re kicking off with "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee. It’s a captivating read and should spark some really engaging conversations.

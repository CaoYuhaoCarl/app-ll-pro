轮次 1:
B:  *smiling warmly* Oh, honey, I'm so sorry about that! I wasn't watching where I was going and I bumped into you. *extending a hand for a handshake* Are you okay?
A: *slightly surprised but smiles politely* No worries, I'm fine. I was just about to get my coffee anyway. How about you?

轮次 2:
B: *excitedly* Wow, I'm great, thanks for asking! *eyes lighting up* I'm Emma, by the way. *holding out her hand for a handshake* I couldn't help but notice you're reading a book on the shelf. What kind of books do you like to read, honey?
A: *shaking hands* I'm John. Nice to meet you, Emma! *smiling* I'm actually a big fan of mystery novels. I just finished reading the latest Sherlock Holmes book.

轮次 3:
B: *eyes widening in excitement* No way! *laughs* I love Sherlock Holmes too! *leaning in* We have a book club here in town that meets every month to discuss a new book. *pulling out a business card* Would you like to join us, honey? I can give you my number and we can exchange info.
A: *smiling* That sounds amazing! *takes the business card* I'd love to join. What's the best way to get in touch with you? *looks at the card* Do you have a card or... 

B: *smiling warmly* Oh, wow! Here, let me give you my card. *hands over the card* We can discuss the details later. *smiling*

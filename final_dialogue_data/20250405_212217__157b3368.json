My god, have you read it? **Actually, it's for my book club**. We meet just around the corner, like, every two weeks. We're going to be **reading** this one for next week's **meeting**!\n**A:** (Nods slowly) Yes. Good book.

Really hope to see you there!\n**A:** (A very faint smile touches lips) Right. Good timing. (Glances at phone) Got the notification. Thanks again for everything, B. It was nice **meeting** you too. See you.",

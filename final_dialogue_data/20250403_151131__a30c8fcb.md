Round 1:  
B: (Bounces lightly on her toes, eyes wide) "My god, I'm so sorry! I completely missed you there. Are you okay after our little collision?"  
A: (Quietly) "No worries at all. I'm fine, just a bit startled. I was just getting my coffee."  

Round 2:  
B: (Clapping her hands with excitement) "That's good to hear! By the way, I'm part of a local reading club that meets here every week. Would you like to join us at the next meeting? If you don't mind, could you share your contact details so I can send you the information? I would certainly appreciate it."  
A: (Nervously smiling) "That sounds wonderful! I love reading. Sure, you can reach me at myemail@example.com."  

Round 3:  
B: (Grinning broadly) "Great, I'll send you all the details soon and look forward to having you with our group. Enjoy your coffee and have a great day!"  
A: (Softly) "Thank you! I'm excited to join and see you all there."  

Round 4:  
A: (Hesitantly) "By the way, since we're talking about the reading club, could we exchange contacts? It would be great to chat about upcoming book discussions."  
B: (Cheerfully) "Absolutely! I usually use WhatsApp. Would you mind sharing your number so I can add you to our group chat?"  

Round 5:  
A: (Mumbling a quick response) "Sure thing! My number is 123-456-7890. Feel free to add me anytime."  
B: (Typing excitedly on her phone) "Great, I've saved it. Once you're added, I'll send you all the details about our meetings and reading list for the next session."  

Round 6:  
A: "Awesome, thanks so much. I'm really looking forward to connecting with everyone and joining the discussions."  
B: (Winking playfully) "My pleasure! I’m excited to have you with us. Enjoy your coffee and see you in the group chat soon!"  

Round 7:  
A: (Quietly, with a hint of anticipation) "By the way, could you share your contact info with me? I’d love to stay updated and coordinate for our next reading club meet-up."  
B: (Enthusiastically) "Absolutely, let’s swap details—I’ll send you my number and email right away so we can keep in touch about all our club plans!"

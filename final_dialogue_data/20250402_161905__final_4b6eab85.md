A: Excuse me, I’m really sorry about that.
B: Wow, no problem at all.
A: (Noticing the book in your hand) Oh, that’s the exact edition I’ve been looking for.
B: Wow, really? It’s one of my all-time favorites—I’ve read it more times than I can count.
A: I enjoy literature, travel, and music. Seems we have a few common interests.
B: Wow, absolutely! I’m into reading, love exploring new places, and music is always a big part of my life.
A: Would you mind if we sat down and talked a bit longer? This chance meeting feels meaningful.
B: Wow, not at all—I’d love that. Actually, I was just about to invite someone to a book club meeting later this week with a group of like-minded friends. You should definitely join us.
A: That sounds really nice. I’d like to meet them and share more about our interests. Could we swap contact details?
B: Wow, of course. And by the way, you might already know my name—I’m the writer you follow on that social platform. It feels like fate brought us together. I can’t wait for our next meeting and all the growth our shared passions will bring.

## Rewritten Dialogue

**Round 1:**
WOMAN: *bumps into him energetically* "Oh my god! I'm so sorry, honey! I totally didn't see you getting up! Did I splash any coffee on you? I'm such a klutz sometimes!"

MAN: *speaks softly, looking down* "No... it's fine. I should have been more careful too. I wasn't really paying attention. Um... is your coffee okay?"

**Round 2:**
WOMAN: "It's absolutely fine, honey! Just a tiny splash!" *leans in excitedly* "My god, is that 'The Midnight Library' you're reading? I've been dying to get my hands on that book! The cover is gorgeous!"

MAN: *holds the book closer to his chest, speaking quietly* "Yes... I'm actually enjoying it quite a bit. Have you... um... read any other books by Matt Haig? My book club is discussing this one next week."

**Round 3:**
WOMAN: "No, I haven't, but my god, I'd absolutely love to! Your book club sounds amazing!" *gestures enthusiastically* "Are you guys looking for new members? I've been searching everywhere for people to talk books with, honey!"

MAN: *nods slightly, gaining a bit of confidence* "We do accept new members. We meet here... at this café on Thursday evenings. If you want, we could exchange contact information. I could add you to our group chat."

**Round 4:**
WOMAN: "That would be perfect, honey! Here's my number!" *hands over phone animatedly* "What kind of books do you all read? I'm into everything - fiction, philosophy, you name it! My god, I get so excited about good books!"

MAN: *carefully takes her phone, inputs information with focused attention* "We read different things... we're quite diverse." *returns phone gently* "Last month was 'The Midnight Library' and now we're on 'Sapiens.' I added you to the group, so you'll see what's next soon."

**Round 5:**
WOMAN: "My god, 'Sapiens' has been on my list forever! What a coincidence!" *dramatically pulls out a book from her bag* "Look what I brought today, honey! Do you know this author? They're amazing!"

MAN: *glances at the book, a small smile forming* "I actually really like that writer. Their insight into relationships is... profound." *hesitates before continuing* "Some members are having coffee at that corner table now. It's informal, before the official meeting. Would you like to join? If that's not too much."

**Round 6:**
WOMAN: "I'd be absolutely delighted to join, honey! My god, this is so exciting!" *quickly gathers her things with enthusiasm* "Lead the way! I can't wait to meet everyone and get a feel for your discussions before Thursday!"

MAN: *gestures toward the table with a subtle hand movement* "I think they'll appreciate someone with your... taste in literature. You'll probably fit in well with our group."

**Round 7:**
WOMAN: *walks alongside him with a bright smile* "Thank you for making me feel so welcome, honey! My god, I've been searching for something exactly like this since moving here!" *rummages energetically in her bag* "Oh! We should totally exchange info so you can send me the details for Thursday! Here you go!"

MAN: *carefully inputs his information* "Of course. I'll text you the address and time. We usually bring snacks to share, but don't worry about that for your first time." *hands the phone back, maintaining brief eye contact* "I'm actually glad we ran into each other. Sometimes accidents lead to good things."

**Round 8:**
WOMAN: *laughs heartily* "My god, definitely the most fortunate coffee spill ever, honey!" *puts phone away with a flourish* "Let me buy you another coffee before we join the others! It's the least I can do since yours ended up decorating the floor!"

MAN: *smiles slightly, appearing more comfortable* "That's very kind of you. I'd appreciate that. And while we wait... maybe you could tell me about that Murakami novel you mentioned? I've wanted to try his work but wasn't sure where to start."

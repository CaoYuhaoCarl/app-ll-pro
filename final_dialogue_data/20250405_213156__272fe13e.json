My god, are you okay?  \nA: (softly, with a cautious smile) No problem at all! I'm fine, thanks. I was getting my coffee too. Oh, is that \"The Midnight Library\" you're reading?\n\nRound 2:\nB: (energetically, waving a hand as if to emphasize her excitement) Yes, it is! My god, have you read it? Actually, it's for my book club. We meet not far from here every two weeks. We're discussing this one next week.  \nA: (quietly, with a measured nod) Really? I loved that book! I've been looking for a local book club. Is it easy to join?\n\nRound 3:\nB: (bubbling with enthusiasm, tapping her phone lightly as she speaks) My god, it's very easy! We're always happy to have new members. Maybe we could exchange numbers? I can send you the details about our next meeting and add you to our group chat if you like.  \nA: (with a reserved, gentle tone) That sounds fantastic! Yes, please. My number is [User's imaginary number]. I'd love to get the details.\n\nRound 4:\nB: (cheerfully, with a playful grin as she quickly inputs the number) Great, got it! [User's imaginary number]... saved. My god, my number is [Assistant's imaginary number]. I'm B, by the way. What's your name? I'll text you the details later today.  \nA: (calmly, with a slight nod) Thanks, B! Saved yours too. I'm A. Nice to meet you properly! Sounds good, I'll look out for your text. What kind of books do you usually read in the club?\n\nRound 5:\nB: (radiantly, clapping her hands together in delight) Nice to meet you too, A! My god, we read a mix – fiction, non-fiction, sometimes classics, sometimes newer releases. The next one is a contemporary fiction novel; I'll include the title in the message. I'll add you to the WhatsApp group shortly so you can see our discussions and vote on future books too!  \nA: (quietly appreciative, with a small smile) Oh, that sounds like a great variety! Perfect. Thanks so much for inviting me and for all the info, B. I really appreciate it and I'm already looking forward to it.\n\nRound 6:\nB: (with sparkling eyes and a playful laugh, giving a quick wave) You're very welcome, A! My god, it was lovely bumping into you – literally! Okay, I've just sent you the details and added you to the group chat. Check when you have a moment. Hope to see you at the next meeting!  \nA: (chuckling softly, nodding in acknowledgment) Haha, the best kind of bump-in! Perfect, I see the notification now. Thanks again for everything, B! It was great meeting you too. See you soon, hopefully!",

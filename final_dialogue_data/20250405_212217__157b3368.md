```
Okay, here is the rewritten dialogue reflecting the specified character traits:

**Round 1:**

**B:** (Eyes wide, juggling coffee cup slightly, voice effervescent) Oh, my god, **excuse me**! **I'm so sorry**, totally spaced out, wasn't watching where I was going! Are you alright?
**A:** (Looks up briefly, voice quiet) **No problem**. I'm fine. Getting coffee. (Eyes flick to the book in B's hand) **Is that "The Midnight Library" you're reading?**

**Round 2:**

**B:** (Beaming, leans forward slightly with enthusiasm) Yes, it is! My god, have you read it? **Actually, it's for my book club**. We meet just around the corner, like, every two weeks. We're going to be **reading** this one for next week's **meeting**!
**A:** (Nods slowly) Yes. Good book. (Pauses, looking thoughtful) **I've been looking for a local book club**. **Is it easy to join?**

**Round 3:**

**B:** (Claps hands together lightly, grin widens) Oh, my god, SO easy! We absolutely love getting new people! Hey, **maybe we could exchange numbers? I can send you the details about our next meeting** and add you to our **group chat** right away if you're up for it!
**A:** (Considers for a moment, then pulls out phone) Okay. **That sounds fantastic!** Yes, please. My number is [User's imaginary number]. The **details** would be good.

**Round 4:**

**B:** (Typing quickly into phone, smiling brightly) Awesome, got it! [User's imaginary number]... saved! My number's [Assistant's imaginary number]. (Looks up expectantly) I'm B, by the way! And you are...? My god, completely forgot to ask! I’ll text you those **details** later today.
**A:** (Saves B's number, nods) Thanks, B. Saved. I'm A. Nice to meet you. (Pockets phone) Okay. What kind of books does the **book club** usually cover?

**Round 5:**

**B:** (Gesturing animatedly with hands) So nice meeting you too, A! Oh, my god, we read *everything*! Fiction, non-fiction, sometimes classics, sometimes brand new stuff – a real mix! The next one is a contemporary fiction novel, super interesting. I'll pop the title in the message. (Whips out phone again briefly) I'll add you to the WhatsApp **group chat** in a bit so you can see what we talk about and vote on future books too! Hope you'll **join** in!
**A:** (Voice remains level, but a hint of interest) Good variety. Perfect. Thank you for the invite and the info, B. I appreciate it. Looking forward to the **meeting**.

**Round 6:**

**B:** (Grinning, gives a little cheerful bounce) My god, you are SO welcome, A! Best coffee shop collision ever, right?! Okay, *zap* - just sent the **details** and added you to the **group chat** now! (Winks playfully) Check when you get a chance. Really hope to see you there!
**A:** (A very faint smile touches lips) Right. Good timing. (Glances at phone) Got the notification. Thanks again for everything, B. It was nice **meeting** you too. See you.

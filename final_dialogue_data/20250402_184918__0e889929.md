B: Emm, no worries at all! Accidents happen.

Round 2:
A: I couldn't help but notice the book you're reading—it’s exactly the edition I've been searching for!
B: Emm, really? I'm glad you appreciate it. It's one of my favorites too.

Round 3:
A: I love reading too! I also enjoy traveling and listening to cool music. What about you?
B: Emm, I feel the same. Literature, travel, and music are my passions. It's so nice to meet someone who shares the vibe.

Round 4:
A: It’s amazing how much we have in common. Mind if we sit together and chat more?
B: Emm, not at all! In fact, I actually run a small reading club. Would you like to join us sometime?

Round 5:
A: A reading club sounds awesome. I've been looking for a community to share my love for books.

A: Can we swap contact details so you can send me the club meeting info?
B: Emm, of course! Here’s my phone number and email—let’s definitely stay in touch.

Round 8:
A: By the way, I just noticed your name—it’s the same as an author I've admired on social media!
B: Emm, what a coincidence! I never expected to meet someone who pays that kind of attention.

Round 9:
A: It almost feels like this meeting was meant to be—fate really brought us together.
B: Emm, I totally agree. Sometimes the smallest moments lead to the most meaningful connections.

Round 10:
A: Thanks for inviting me to your reading club. I’m really looking forward to our next meeting and future chats.

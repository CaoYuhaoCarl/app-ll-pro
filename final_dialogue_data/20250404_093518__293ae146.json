Are you okay?  \nA (composed, reserved tone): I’m fine, thank you. It was just a small accident. No worries.  \n\nRound 2:  \nB (eyes lighting up, a cheerful chuckle): Wow, that’s good to hear! What, I noticed you have a book with you—do you enjoy reading?  \nA (soft voice, avoiding too much eye contact): Yes. I love reading. I usually look for people or a book club to discuss books with.  \n\nRound 3:  \nB (excitedly clasping hands together, leaning forward): Oh wow! I’m actually part of a local book club. If you’re interested, I can share the details with you. Maybe we can exchange contacts?  \nA (hesitates briefly, then nods slightly): That sounds fine. Here’s my number. I’d like to join the book club, discuss literature, and meet others.  \n\nRound 4:  \nB (beaming widely, tapping phone to save number): Thank you! My god, I’ve saved your number. I’ll add you to our book club group chat shortly! We meet every Saturday afternoon at the café down the street.

I’m curious—what book are you all reading now?  \n\nRound 5:  \nB (excitedly clasping hands, eyes sparkling): Wow, we’re currently reading “The Book Thief” by Markus Zusak. It’s such a touching story. If you haven’t started yet, you still have time before this week’s meeting!  \nA (nods quietly): Good choice. I’ve heard wonderful things, but haven’t read it yet. I’ll pick up a copy today to catch up.  \n\nRound 6:  \nB (with an enthusiastic wave, smiling warmly): Fantastic! My god, I’m so glad you’re joining us, Honey. Everyone’s really friendly—we love new perspectives. Just let me know if you have any questions!  \nA (soft, brief smile): Thank you.

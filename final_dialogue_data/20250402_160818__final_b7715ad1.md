A: Um, excuse me—I’m really sorry for bumping into you.  
B: Wow, no worries at all! Are you okay?  
A: Yes, thank you. I noticed the book you’re holding—it’s actually the exact edition I’ve been looking for.  
B: Wow, seriously? I’m so glad you like it! It’s one of my all-time favorites because of its classic style.  
A: I, uh, really enjoy literature, travel, and music too. It’s nice to meet someone who shares those interests.  
B: Wow, that’s amazing! Actually, I’m putting together a reading club soon. Would you be interested in joining?  
A: That sounds great—I’d love to join. Also, could I trouble you for your signature on that book? It would make it even more special.  
B: Absolutely, here’s my signature! And, wow, let’s swap contact details—my name is Michael, in case you know me from my writing online.  
A: Michael? Wow, you’re the author I’ve admired on social media for so long! I’m really honored to meet you in person. By the way, would you like to come over at my place sometime? We could continue our conversation over coffee or dinner.

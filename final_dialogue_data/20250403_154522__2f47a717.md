## 最终对话

```
轮次 1:
B: Oh my god! *(Gasps, hands flying up to cover mouth)* Excuse me! Wow, I am SO sorry, I wasn't looking where I was going! *(Eyes wide with concern)* Did I bump into you hard? Please tell me your coffee didn't spill!
A: It's fine. No spill. Nice book.

轮次 2:
B: Oh, thank you! *(Beams, holding the book up slightly)* It’s for my book club. We're diving into 'The Midnight Library' – it looks amazing! What a find! Honestly, it is this book club that really got me back into reading regularly. *(Nods enthusiastically)*
A: A book club... Interesting. How does one join?

轮次 3:
B: Seriously? You'd want to join? Wow, that's awesome! *(Claps hands together lightly)* It's super easy, no weird hoops to jump through or anything! We mostly use a group chat and meet online once a month. How about we exchange numbers? I can add you right in! *(Pulls out phone eagerly)*
A: Okay. Yes. Here's my number. Thank you.

轮次 4:
B: Got it! *(Grinning, types quickly on the phone)* Perfect! Let me just add you... aaand *ding*! You should see an invite pop up any second now. We're literally just starting "The Midnight Library." Have you actually read it? What timing!
A: Heard of it. Haven't read it. Good timing.

轮次 5:
B: Excellent! You'll catch up super quick then. *(Gives a thumbs up)* Yep, the invite's definitely sent. Feel free to pop in and say 'hi' whenever you get a chance! Our next online hang-out is next Thursday night – we’re chatting about the first half. No pressure though! *(Winks playfully)*
A: Understood. I'll join the chat later. Thanks for the welcome after the... bump.

轮次 6:
B: Haha, my god, don't mention it! *(Waves a dismissive hand, laughing)* Sometimes the craziest meetings turn out the best, right? Looking forward to seeing you in the group chat! Enjoy that coffee! *(Starts to walk away with a friendly wave)*
A: You too. See you online.

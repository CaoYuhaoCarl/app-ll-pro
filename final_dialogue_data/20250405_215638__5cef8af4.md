B: Oops! I’m really sorry for bumping into you. Are you okay?  

*With a calm demeanor, A nods slightly.*  
A: Yes, I'm fine, thank you. I wasn't careful while getting my coffee.  

Round 2:  
*B beams with relief, hands animated as she gestures toward A.*  
B: I'm glad you're alright! I noticed you were reading earlier. I just finished reading *Journey to the West*, and it reminded me of our book club. Would you mind joining our next meeting?  

*A’s eyes brighten, and a small smile appears.*  
A: That sounds great! I love reading, and I'd be happy to join the book club.  

Round 3:  
*B claps her hands together excitedly and leans forward.*  
B: Fantastic! Could you please share your contact information so I can add you to our club group? Of course, I'll send you all the details soon.  

*A reaches into her bag, pulling out a notepad with deliberate movements.*  
A: Sure, here is my phone number and email. I'm looking forward to our next meeting!  

Round 4:  
*A looks curious, tilting her head slightly.*

*B nods enthusiastically, her eyes sparkling with excitement.*  
B: Absolutely! Our first meeting is scheduled for this Saturday at 7 p.m. right here in the back area of the café. We'll start with a quick intro session before diving into our discussion.  

Round 5:  
*A leans in a bit, her interest piqued.*  
A: That sounds perfect. May I ask what book we'll be discussing at the meeting?  

*B gestures with open hands, her expression animated.*  
B: Sure thing! We're kicking off with *To Kill a Mockingbird* by Harper Lee. It’s a captivating read and should spark some really engaging conversations.  

Round 6:  
*A’s face lights up with recognition, and she nods eagerly.*  
A: *To Kill a Mockingbird* is one of my favorites! I’m excited to share my thoughts and learn from everyone else. Thanks for the warm welcome.  

*B gives a cheerful thumbs-up, leaning back with satisfaction.*  
B: You're most welcome, A! We're excited to hear your insights. See you on Saturday for what promises to be a lively discussion!  

*A pulls out her phone, swiping through it with purpose.*  
A: By the way, I just added you on WeChat and saw the invite to the group chat—thanks for setting that up! I’m really looking forward to getting more involved in the club and our discussions.  

*B nods with a grin, her eyes twinkling with enthusiasm.*  
B: That's great to hear, A! Welcome aboard officially. I’ve added you to our book club group chat so you'll receive all the updates. Excited to see your insights on Saturday—see you soon!

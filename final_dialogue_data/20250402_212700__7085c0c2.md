## 最终对话

```
A: Excuse me, I'm really sorry for bumping into you while I was getting my coffee.

B: Wow, that's perfectly okay, sweetheart! It happens all the time!

A: I noticed you're holding the exact edition of the book I've been searching for.

B: Wow, really? That's such a rare find! This is one of my absolute favorites—I love how it sparks all kinds of interesting conversations.

A: Yes, I enjoy discussing books and exploring new perspectives. It seems we have a shared passion.

B: Wow, absolutely, sweetheart! I even belong to a local literature club where we chat about our favorite reads and swap ideas.

A: That sounds great. I'd really like to get to know you better and maybe even join your club.

B: Wow, I'd love to have you join, sweetheart! Here's some information about our next meeting. Welcome aboard, new friend!
